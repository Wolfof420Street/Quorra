## Description
The Quorra by Angular is a webpage that initiates the user to enter quotes, and display them back to the user

Once the user submits the quotes, the quote appears on the QUOTES Section in the webpage.

The author of the quote and the number of likes the quotes have are hidden in the details section. Pressing the details section will reveal the details.

The details section has a delete button. Pressing the delete button will delete the entire quote from the page.

A user can like or dislike a quote. The quote with the highest quote becomes highlighted in red.
